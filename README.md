# py-darts-scoreboard

Darts scoreholder.

Another college assignment but for my Python class.
The brief was create anything to be used for a sport or hobby.

Holds scores of up to 2 people/teams.
Can switch between teams at any time.
Counts down from 501 as per official game rules but can be changed.
Takes in each score per dart per turn and takes away from score.
Designed with a Tkinter GUI.

TO USE:
1. Download both files (darts_GUI.py GUI file AND player.py class file).
2. Open whatever you use to run .py files - I use VSCode or PyCharm.
3. Run "darts_GUI.py".

TL;DR:
I made a scoreboard app that records darts scores.
